                    <h4>1. Data controller</h4>
                    <p>
                        The controller responsible for processing your personal data on this website is:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Matikus Games</strong><br />

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about how your data is processed, you can

                    </p>

                    <h4>2. What data is collected and for what purpose?</h4>

                    <h5>2.1 Newsletter and updates</h5>
                    <p>
                        If you subscribe to my newsletter or development updates, I collect and process:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Email address</li>
                        <li>Name or nickname</li>
                        <li>Any other information you choose to provide in the form</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sending newsletters, devlogs, progress updates and information about current or future
                            games.</li>
                        <li>Occasionally asking for feedback, playtests or surveys related to Matikus Games.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Your consent according to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future, for example by using the
                        unsubscribe link in my emails or by contacting me directly at
                        <span class="email-dev"></span></span>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Use of Tally for forms</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the newsletter form and other contact or feedback forms, this website uses the service
                        <strong>Tally.so</strong>, operated by Tally BV, a company based in the European Union.
                        When you submit a form, your form inputs are processed and stored by Tally on servers they
                        operate. Tally acts as a data processor on my behalf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tally may also collect technical information such as your IP address, browser type and version,
                        and the date and time of submission.
                        Further information about data processing by Tally can be found in Tally’s own Privacy Policy at
                        <a href="https://tally.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tally.so</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>4. Email communication</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you contact me directly by email, I will process the data you provide (email address, content
                        of your message, name, attachments)
                        in order to answer your request and, if necessary, to maintain a conversation or relationship
                        with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract or steps prior to entering
                        into a contract)
                        or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in answering inquiries and building a community
                        around my games).
                    </p>

                    <h4>5. Data retention</h4>
                    <p>
                        Newsletter data is stored as long as you are subscribed. If you unsubscribe, your email address
                        will be removed from the active mailing list.
                        I may keep minimal information in a suppression list to ensure you do not receive further emails
                        by mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Form submissions that are no longer needed for the original purpose will be deleted or
                        anonymised within a reasonable period.
                    </p>

                    <h4>7. Cookies and tracking</h4>
                    <p>
                        At the current stage, this website does not intentionally use cookies or third‑party tracking
                        tools for analytics or advertising beyond what is technically necessary to deliver the site.
